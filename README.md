# SQL-Projcet
The domain that we are modeling is stadium. We are going to focus on the data that is stored about different events in a stadium.

The aspects of the stadium that we will be modeling will be about the events of the stadium. This includes things like the information of the events, the players who attend the events, audience who attend the events, the rooms where events are held, the food services which are applied by employees, the employees who manage the events, the rentals which are rented by audiences, the tickets which are sold by employees and bought by audience.

This database provides a template for events management in a stadium. The database helps to analyze data in various ways and creates provision for multiple views of data.

There will be two different classes of users of the system: the audience and the event employee. The audience will be able to access the tickets information about the events, buy tickets and request for refund. The audience can also change information about their personal profile. The employee of the event will be able to change the event information such as event date, event room number and event price. The employee will have access to all the customer data (customer personal information, customer ticket information). Only the event employee will be able to change the event information, customer ID and give customer refund.
 
The projcet will be done using the CS department's Oracle database system, using PHP.

Our expected application technology stacks are Microsoft Excel, Oracle, PHP, Google doc and so on.
